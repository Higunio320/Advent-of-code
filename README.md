## Advent of Code Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to Advent of Code puzzles. If you wish to use them, simply provide an input file and update the `PATH_TO_INPUT` variable at the top of each solution to point to your file. Then run the main function of the solution file to get the answer.

Please be aware that these solutions may not be fool-proof and could break with incorrect input. It's important to note that my code is designed to work only with correct input files obtained directly from the [original Advent of Code page](https://adventofcode.com/).

Unfortunately, I cannot share my own input files as the creator of Advent of Code has requested not to do so.
